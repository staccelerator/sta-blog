    "title": "Security tokens: long awaited VC markets evolution or yet another buzzword?",
    "body": "2019/02/07 - Security tokens: long awaited VC markets evolution or yet another buzzword?: Illustration: Deloitte. com Recent years have shown a major decline in VCs willing to invest in early stage ventures, leaving multiple startups with bleak chances to get funded and make their impact. Why has venture capital become incapable of fulfilling its initial purpose of driving innovation? Is tokenization truly able to make a change, or security tokens are just another buzzword and a leftover from ICOs?: VCs less willing to fund early stage startups: According to Venture Pulse research by KPMG, international VC scene has seen a sharp decline in early stage deals over the past few years. We can now witness venture capital firms acting more cautious and private equity-ish, sticking to the ‚Äúnew late-stage/growth equity hybrid model that facilitates massive unicorn rounds‚Äù. The general decrease in the number of deals in 2018 reflects the pattern clearly enough. Adding up to the trend, the number of VC-backed exits have been decreasing since 2014, making the chances of a venture-funded company for M&amp;A or an IPO more subtle with every year, as of Pitchbook. Lengthening exit timelines, which have never been short in the first place (7‚Äì12 years on average), forces VCs to play safe and makes the industry long for alternatives. The biggest pain of venture capital is liquidity, and time pressure of the modern world makes it less and less affordable. As we keep racing into the digital paradigm, the 60-year-old VC system seems to be struggling to fulfill its initial role of boosting early stage ventures. Current VCs want traction and proven market fit and, ironically enough, cultivate the short-term thinking by doing so. The chances for innovations to be left out are pretty high in this scenario. Blockchain to help: Blockchain has brought the new fundraising promise. Even though it took an (arguably) wrong turn first with the ICO hysteria, it has matured in the process and has now come up with a new idea: let‚Äôs tokenize the real world assets. Here‚Äôs why it makes sense and actually gives a hand to VCs. Tokenization essentially means issuing ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù tokens governed by a smart contract that represent a particular asset (equity, debt, real estate, precious metals, and so on as your imagination can offer) and are fully compliant with securities legislation. While one might argue that these are the same securities, it is not quite so. Tokenization offers multiple promises such as reduced direct costs, 24/7 global markets access, automated compliance, instant settlement, fractional ownership and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääta-da-da!‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincreased liquidity. Investors enjoyed the ICO idea of tokens so much, because it provided almost instant opportunity to get returns. When it comes to traditional investing, investors are unable to further allocate their funds, until the funded venture is acquired or goes public via an IPO, which might take many years. Of course, issuing a security token does not magically provide liquidity per se. That‚Äôs what many former ICO adepts tend to forget about. However, it gives way more options and flexibility for a startup with an innovative (and sustainable) business idea. Alexey Shadrin, Evercity CEO &amp; Co-founder:  ‚ÄúIf we want to live in clean sustainable future, we need to kickstart democratizing and wiping out barriers of raising capital for talented tech teams. Blockchain infrastructure can make legacy VC markets more accessible and transparent to new categories of startups and investors, globally creating an existentially needed innovations boost‚Äù. Diversifying risk for investors and entrepreneurs: Tokenizing equity allows startups and small enterprises to expand their investor base, not relying solely on venture capital as the last resort for funds. Traditionally, deals for private investors in early tech startups start from $20,000 and more. We already see security tokens changing that, with deals starting from several thousands or even hundreds dollars. The minimum investment amount still depends a lot on regulators: for example, this December Neufund was forced to raise the ticket for its ‚Äúequity token offering‚Äù from ‚Ç¨500 to ‚Ç¨100,000 due to the last minute audit, but we are likely to see less of that happening in the future. Allowing wider audience to participate in the round makes diversification and price discovery easier and gives a substantial boost to innovation. In fact, it actually gives a boost to high quality and truly disrupting (excuse my french) innovation: with no promise of immediate pump-and-dump styled returns of a crypto exchange, even non-professional investors will be forced to do their due-diligence and invest in something truly worth it. As for small and medium VC-backed entreprises, stuck in the ‚Äúpurgatory‚Äù being not grown-up enough for an IPO, tokenizing their equity can help them avoid unfavorable acquisitions and let early investors exit and release the money flow for further innovations, as Vertalo CEO Dave Hendricks put it in his article. On top of that, security tokens are a way of getting a quick feedback from the industry, which can be a helpful instrument for VCs. Additional liquidity, introduced by tokenization, mitigates the risks and makes startups a more attractive investment opportunity. In its turn, it empowers many more entrepreneurs to create innovation and achieve their dreams. Thus, tokenization introduces a new fundraising method that is evolving into something between traditional VC investments and crowd sales. Denis Soldatov, founder of Russian-speaking Ethereum community and DevOps in Parity Technologies:  ‚ÄúBlockchain itself does not solve the liquidity problem. Investors who prefer to invest in crypto assets do. They choose lower entry barriers and fast, secure and transparent asset conversion in investment portfolio. Blockchain does not have any limits or borders, except those that market participants agree on to reach consensus. For example, using DAO functionality for co-financing‚Äù. Tokenization is already making the moves to transform the venture capital system by creating tokenized funds, that might in fact create this miraculous liquidity for investors‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand make VCs more relaxed and eager to invest in early stage venture again. We will get back to this topic in our next article, coming next week on Security Token Accelerator blog.

    "body": "2018/11/14 - On 9‚Äì11th November a 48-hour-long hackaton, dedicated to the search of innovative blockchain-based solutions for energy markets took place in ‚ÄúTablica‚Äù coworking space in Moscow. As one of achievements, a team from Saint Petersburg presented the first prototype in the world for green certificates on blockchain. Energy Blockchain Hack, organized by Evercity venture ecosystem and ‚ÄúRussian Carbon‚Äù fund, became the first event of this kind in Russia, bringing together blockchain developers and global leaders in energy field. Schneider Electric and Hevel Solar acted as strategic partners of the hackathon. Over 100 specialists, students of technical institutions and representatives of energy-related startups took part in the development, competing for the prize pool of 400,000 RUB and opportunity to collaborate with the leading market players. The hackathon was a part of the global Climathon initiative that united 130 cities and over 4000 developers internationally. The main goal of the hackathon was the search of new talents and technologies for the phase transition in Russian and international energy industries. A choice of 4 themed tracks was available for participating teams:  ‚ÄúEnergy management: smart contracts for verification of energy efficiency and mutual settlements with clients‚ÄùTeam ‚ÄúWinners‚Äù suggested the best solution in the nomination by the event‚Äôs strategic partner Schneider Electric‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa leader in electric energy and energy management. Team from Moscow developed the architecture of smart contracts and interface to optimize machinery and track the level of customer satisfaction, reducing costs for efficiency and eliminating human factor.  ‚ÄúCreation of digital infrastructure of green certificates on blockchain‚ÄùSaint-Petersburg team ‚ÄúKORUM‚Äù won the prize from the strategic partner of the hackathon Hevel Solar‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe biggest integrated company in Russia in the field of solar energy. The members presented their solution for the problem of proof that generated energy is really ‚Äúgreen‚Äù. The model ‚Äúcertificate=token‚Äù includes audit of power station by the managing body, recording of the process by sensors and emission of tokens in the end of the process, which can later be sold to organizations.  ‚ÄúElectric transport: creation of platform to stimulate the usage of electric vehicles based on smart contracts‚ÄùThe partner of the event‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEDF (√âlectricit√© de France), international leader in energy generation with low CO2 emissions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääawarded the team ‚ÄúHypeTrain‚Äù for development of an application which allows major socially-oriented businesses, interested in obtaining green certificates, to attract owners of green electric vehicles for a set of tasks (delivery, etc). In case of successful task completion, users receive tokens and carbon units. The goal of the application is to incentivize people to use electric transport with participation of business players.  ‚ÄúDistributed energy: development, smart contracts implementation and payments control on blockchain‚ÄùAs a part of the nomination by NP ‚ÄúMarket Council‚Äù and ‚ÄúRosseti‚Äù, team ‚ÄúStarBlock‚Äù suggested a solution for a widespread problem of network companies, which suffer losses when users fail to comply with the network regime (amortization, overload and spare capacity). The presented solution is a system of members incentivization via bonuses for conscientious users and penalties for violators. The team pleasantly surprised the jury, having created a real physical IoT sensor to register compliance with conditions, as well as a working application and a smart contract. In the course of the awarding ceremony Oleg Barkin, Vice Chairman of the Board of NP ‚ÄúMarket Council‚Äù, noted the importance of the topic and relevance of suggested solutions.  ‚ÄúEnergy is a very complex field, but I hope that new technologies will change it. I want to express gratitude to the organizers and respect to those teams who made it to the finals and showed the best projects. There‚Äôs a lot of work to be done and a lot of implementation opportunities in Russia. I also see the potential that these solutions will be in high demand all over the world‚Äù.  Renowned blockchain companies Parity, Airalab, DAO IPCI and Onder acted as technological partners of the hackathon. They lead a series of workshops for participants during the event and provided their technologies to help solve the cases. Hackathon finalists were also granted certificates for participation in the first Robonomics winter school by Airalab team. Alexey Shadrin, Evercity CEO shared his impressions on the event:  ‚ÄúThe level of the developed solutions dazzled our mentors and partners. Upon their request, we will make Energy Blockchain Hackathon an annual event! The next hackathon by Evercity will take place in early 2019 and will be dedicated to smart sustainable cities‚Äù.

    "body": "2018/10/18 - Current state of STO market: notes on the sidelines of Security Token Industry Launch event in NYC: ‚ÄúWatching panels on STOs is like eavesdropping on a group of 9th graders talking about sex. A lot of talk, very little real experience, but a lot of enthusiasm about it happening in the near future‚Äù,‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDave Hendricks (Vertalo): Special thanks to Jor Law (VerifyInvestor. com), Rika Khurdayan (Dilendorf &amp; Khurdayan), Ivan Podmasko (Scrypta) for helping prepare this article On 5th October, the bell rang to mark the official Security Token Industry Launch in NYC. The high level event, taking place in Conrad Hotel NYC and sponsored by Merrill Lynch (Bank of America group) among others, brought together leading Wall Street finance &amp; legal professionals and visionaries, united by (a bit mystical) ideas of security tokenisation. The event was opened a night before by a networking cruise around Manhattan: a metaphor clear enough to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in the same boat‚Äù. Security Token Industry Launch was one of the most attended events in NYC crypto space recently, with such excitement only otherwise seen at the Consensus conference in May. Consensus, however, failed to meet general to-the-moon expectations. For the past few months, the industry has obviously lacked enthusiasm as ICOs lost their rock star status. Now, security tokens seem determined to get the party going. The event organiser‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSecurity Token Academy‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähas done excellent job bringing in industry experts and organising informative panels on all aspects of the new intriguing STO market: regulation, technical foundations, issuance and secondary market. The official part was opened by a Wall Street perspective from a former NASDAQ Vice Chairman David Wield, who covered the current state of the technology adoption. Among other highlights, Fabian Vogelsteller (creator of ERC-20 standard) presented technical foundation and liquidity promises of security tokens. Other speakers included CEOs and founders of the most advanced industry players: Securitize, Polymath, tZero, Swarm Fund, Neufund and others.  Investor panel with Ryan Alfred (Framework), Stephen McKeon (Security Token Academy), Carlos Domingo (Securitize), Gregory Keough (Finova) All panels agreed on one thing: Security Tokens might still be in their early days, but they are here to stay. Lately, Wall Street whales have been showing close interest in the topic, which resulted in some serious institutional acquisitions. For example, Goldman Sach-back Circle (whose founder Jeremy Allaire also gave a speech on the event) this month announced acquisition of SeedInvest to focus on security token issuance &amp; trading. However, despite the growing global hype around the topic and sincere enthusiasm of the participants, a question rose in almost every discussion: what exactly is a Security Token? For now, everybody has their own perspective. However, not for long as the industry will soon gain consensus on this point. Battlefield US: a Saga of the Year 2018: United States took up on the role of the main STO battlefield, as the market seems to be mature enough to embrace security tokens as a rightful fundraising method. The whole ecosystem is now standing still waiting for signals from the regulator. While SEC has almost zero tolerance to the concept of utility tokens, significant lobbyist battles are now taking place in Senate and other legislative battlegrounds. The nation is trying to make up its mind on what a security token is, after all,‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand what to do with it. What promises STOs hold for democratisation of the market?  For those unfamiliar with financial markets, who never had a broker or a terminal in Saxo Bank, it‚Äôs hard to imagine how bureaucratised and complex the current market is. Blockchain allows the decrease in the number of intermediaries and simplifies market access to people with small funds: imagine being able to buy 1/100 of Apple‚Äôs stock.  Blockchain and its distributed ledger attributes make it possible to migrate the record of dealings to a more transparent and credible basis. Some experts believe that in three years‚Äô time we will see a massive shift from traditional off-chain electronic book-entry, to a recording of ownership entirely on the distributed ledger.  Smart contracts and their combinations in protocols will enable automated trading and other operations with securities. Such exchanges will be open 24/7. No more 9 to 6 on workdays.  Cost reduction: a recent research shows the cost benefits of an STO in comparison with traditional private placement.  Stablecoins also provide an exceptional opportunity to create instruments to protect investors from fiat &amp; crypto volatility. Participation of such heavy-weight entities as NASDAQ subsidiaries alongside with colossal advantages of the technology leave no doubts that we will sooner or later see STO market growth. To make it sooner, we have to be efficient in overcoming multiple issues. Waking up from the utility token dream: Security Token Offering (STO) differs from already the notorious initial coin offering (ICO) concept in several core features:  EssenceUtility tokens issued via ICOs are designed to serve as an internal currency to pay for particular services within an app. Security tokens are explicitly an investment instrument (equity, debt, other). However, few ICO investors have purchased a project‚Äôs tokens to benefit from its future services. They do so for short to mid-term profits (surprise!). This has lead many projects to inventing a contrived functionality for their tokens, while in fact not needing blockchain at all.  Investor rightsUtility tokens do not provide investors with any rights (except for use within an app). At the end of the day they can only be traded on a crypto exchange. Security tokens represent particular ownership &amp; revenue distribution rights, defined by smart contracts. Investors know for sure, what they get for their money.  LegalUtility tokens are not regulated (at least not by typical securities regulation)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe best a project can do is to try and convince everybody that people buy its tokens just to use them within an app. True story. Security tokens are intended to be fully compliant with existings securities legislation, which eliminates the unpleasant possibility to be crashed by SEC or a corresponding institution. That is not the full list‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut the dominance of STO advantages over ICOs is obvious. Like The Eye of Sauron, financial world is waking up from its utility token dream and turning its gaze towards security token offerings. Marrying Wall Street legacy with new technologies: Right now we are witnessing how STOs merge with traditional financial instruments, bringing in accredited investors only and limited secondary trading, multiple KYC / AML / Terrorist / Sanctions checks. Right now, VerifyInvestor. com‚Äôs platform (one of the conference headliners, recently acquired by Overstock‚Äôs subsidiary tZero) is one of the few companies who already provides these actual services.  After multiple talks with Wall Street &amp; blockchain leaders, we have come to point out three key approaches to security tokenisation:  Security Token is a digital securityAdepts of this approach regard security tokens traditional securities, but issued on distributed ledger. It was supported on legislative level by Delaware law back in 2017, which has allowed companies to maintain their list of shareholders and other corporate records using blockchain technology. It is currently applicable for private offerings, but there are some yet unsolved problems connected with entering a secondary market. There are still questions to be answered (how to maintain a list, and who will register changes) and a need for professional compliant services. Professional SEC-registered market players are starting to emerge from traditional financial industry to provide compliant tokenization services. A recent successful case of ownership stake in St Regis Aspen resort being tokenized by Elevated Returns and sold via Templum Markets represent an example of structuring the deal as a traditional single asset real estate investment trust (REIT).  Security Token is a digital asset with limited properties of tradition securities. 3) Security and utility tokens both have their own role in the financial world of the future. The third approach suggests that we cannot ignore utility tokens‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey still exist, even though in reality only 2% of all token offerings constituted true utilities. SEC has already acknowledged the two top cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum as non-securities. Two of Evercity‚Äôs projects are utilities by all parameters, and they are more than real.  Technology foundations panel moderated by Jor Law (VerifyInvestor. com) with Mason Borda (TokenSoft), Rachel Lam (Hedera Hashgraph), Alec 0age (Zeppelin) Applying STO today: Today security token offerings can be applied for:  Tokenized fundsThis is one of the most popular cases by far: tokenization introduces unprecedented liquidity promises for venture funds, which in traditional format require 7‚Äì12 years before the exit alongside with high entry barriers for investors. SPiCE VC fund, whose co-founder Carlos Domingo was a speaker on the Security Token Industry Launch event, implements blockchain into fund management. One of SPiCE portfolio companies is Securitize‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääadvanced platform for security tokenization. By the matter of fact, Carlos suggested that ‚Äúdigital securities‚Äù term should be applied instead of ‚Äúsecurity tokens‚Äù.  EquityAt the moment, there is no precedent of security tokens being 100% equal to equity. Almost all countries require a stock issuer to keep a registry of shareholders, which includes real name and address, rather than simply a cryptocurrency wallet. If blockchain is accepted as a legal way of shareholders‚Äô personal data storage, soon we might witness an example of a security token being equal to real equity. But at the moment, we are still not there.  Debt In September 2018 Austrian government has announced its intentions to issue $1,3 billion worth of bonds on Ethereum public blockchain.  Real estateReal estate community is excited (maybe even more than everyone else) about the advantages of asset tokenization. Imagine being able to ‚Äúshort Manhattan‚Äù and ‚Äúlong Brooklyn‚Äù,‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexample suggested by Stephen McKeon in his Security Token Thesis. Last week Fluidity/AirSwap and Propellr teams announced that they will tokenize $30 million worth of luxury real estate on Manhattan. Elevated Returns (invest-management firm with a focus on real estate) has closed a $18 million deal for Aspen Digital‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoffering of tokens that provide investors with a small ownership stake in St. Regis Aspen Resort. There are multiple potential opportunities around being able to own a small chuck of commercial real estate, for example,‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut even being so seducing, they are still meeting some obstacles.   Migrating traditional stocks to blockchainThis instruments allows to democratize access to existing stocks via selling fractions of a stock for any sum.  Fine artLast month 31,5% of Andy Warhol‚Äôs masterpiece ¬´14 small electric chairs¬ª was tokenized and sold to 100 accredited investors. Art context is another good example for how security tokens provide liquidity to previously illiquid assets, enabling smaller investors to participate in sales. The technology potential is not limited to these examples. We are still at the very early stage of security tokens adoption by the industry, and the perspective are immense. Security Token Industry Launch participants agreed: we should not wait for SEC to change regulations‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe have to convince big players and move the market. Conclusions: We have met multiple platforms and early technology adepts on Security Token Industry Launch event. Sailing on a boat around Manhattan, the industry convinced us once again: security tokens are rad. And they are here to stay. Communication with investors and funds from both sides of the ocean lead us to a clear verdict: security tokens and stable coins are the hottest financial topics right now. The majority of investors is still waiting for markets to stabilize‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut they are ready to invest in real projects. And yes, equity‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot utility tokens. Other markets, such as China, Japan, South Korea are showing a live interest to the US expertise. United States already do have tokenization experience, but it is still not grown up enough to be called an industry. The role of legal providers and other partners is yet too significant, costs are yet too high. However, current leaders took into consideration the diverse (and not always successful) experience of the first project wave, and have put protection of issuers &amp; investors on the pedestal. Because at the end of the day, what we are all looking for is‚Ä¶security. ‚Äî Authors:  Alexey Shadrin, CEO and Founder Evercity&gt; Masha Vyazemskaya, Communications at Evercity Evercity carefully selects best blockchain, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, cleantech, biotech projects in alignment with UN Sustainable development goals helping them to find further investments and deployment in smart cities mainly in Asia- Pacific region and the rest of the world.

    "body": "2018/09/25 - STO vs VC: liquidity &amp; control: Evercity continues the series of articles that analyse the pressing issues of traditional fundraising landscape and the way security tokenization can help to tackle them. In the second part we took a look at how STO offers a more efficient alternative to ICOs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone of the newest (and most notorious) fundraising methods. But security tokenization also steps in to disrupt fundraising giant from the previous century: traditional venture capital system. It is true that venture capital funds have stood behind many mind-blowing success stories and major disruptions of our age. However, the system itself has barely changed for the past 60 years, and right now venture funds represent rather rigid institutions. The whole venture industry is an elite limited-access club ecosystem that sets strict rules and limits to both investors and startups. These limits become harder and harder to deal with as the world moves on in its digital paradigm, starting to outweigh the benefits. Still, VC remains a financial industry which powers humanity‚Äôs tech progress. To what extent STO can change‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor maybe even replace?‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis strategically important sector of the fundraising industry, we are just about to see. VC problem ‚Ññ1: low investor liquidity:  ‚ÄúEvery VC will tell you that its biggest limitation when raising funds is illiquidity‚Äù. If you consider investing your money into venture capital, you have to be fully prepared to lock your funds in for a (very) long term. 7‚Äì12 years in average, to be clear. In this context, thousands of people lining up to give their money to yet another ICO project do not seem too surprising. Venture capital has many advantages over initial coin offerings, legal protection and investor safety not being the least. But liquidity is certainly not on the list. If something changes on the way, an early exit from a VC fund inevitably leads to heavy losses and cannot be executed without approval of management. STO solution:: While issuance of your own security tokens via ICO can be legit an alternative to VC for startups, it can also bring liquidity to traditional venture capital in the form of tokenized funds. In this case, issued tokens represent traditional ownership and revenue rights, while they also provide investors with opportunity to trade these tokens (see: a share in a fund) on secondary markets at any time. This model is currently being implemented, for example, by SPiCE VC. Liquidity means that investor is flexible to make changes in his portfolio: decide when to exit, to trade or to hold his assets in parts. VC problem ‚Ññ2: investor entry barriers: Venture capital sets high standards not only for the startups. So it does for investors. Usually you have to bring in certain (big) sums to join an investment round. Not everyone can afford to forget about their money for the next 7‚Äì12 years and patiently wait for the exit. Even if you can‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you‚Äôll be able to join the party. For example, according to Stephen McKeon: ‚Äúmany of Sequoia Capital venture funds have been notoriously difficult to access, even for some institutional investors‚Äù. STO solution:: While startups can still set a minimum investment amount when doing their own STO, the method is much less demanding to investors. A startup can decide to attract funds from thousands of private investors‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand they just have to be accredited. Talking about a solution for venture capital, security tokens of a VC fund can represent such additional rights as access to certain investment rounds, as per professor McKeon. As an extra bonus, it can make them trade above the net asset value. VC problem ‚Ññ3: loss of control on your startup: From a startup‚Äôs point of view, VCs are not only rainbows and butterflies either. Many young tech startups find it extremely hard and expensive to take care of fundraising campaigns: financial structuring, legal compliance, marketing. In this scenario, venture capital becomes a source of guaranteed, fully compliant investments. But it comes with a price: losing equity stake and control of your creation. As Harvard Business Review put it, ¬´most entrepreneurs want to make a lot of money and to run the show. But it‚Äôs tough to do both¬ª. Private venture capitalists and funds usually require a large equity stake in a startup they invest in. For founders it means losing the ability to make important decisions and having to put up with forced management changes. How would you solve the ¬´Founder‚Äôs Dilemma¬ª? STO solution:: In this regard, STO comes as an alternative to VC that saves startups from giving away their independence. A startup can decide what rights and what amount they are ready to tokenize and sell. In its turn, the DAO principle is able to provide a more efficient decentralized governance model, where decision-making power is given to the community of shareholders, and not to ‚Äúhigher powers‚Äù. At the same time, in comparison with ICOs, security token offering remains a fully legal fundraising method. ‚Äî Ivan Podmasko, Partner @ Emery Capital VC, CEO @ Scrypta &amp; Advisor to Evercity  Raising capital for a start-up is always: structuring the round, capitalization modeling (drafting cap table), determining classes and volumes of issued shares, forecasting the founder‚Äôs dilution, allocating option plans for employees, determining restrictions on the sale of shares and vesting schedules, and, of course, drafting package of legal documents (corporate decisions, contracts, entries into the shareholders register). We can assume that digitalization trend, which is now gaining momentum in the capital markets (and manifesting itself in such a phenomenon as STO‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSecurity Token Offering), will lead in the future to the creation of new mechanisms for capital management through smart contracts on distributed ledgers, simplifying and speeding up not only the process of raising capital and its circulation (thanks to a single digital carrier of information‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor both money and securities‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääblockchain), but also the processes of its modeling and audit. The emergence in a short time of a single transparent environment for programming and accounting of the share capital through convenient interfaces will unite founders and investors‚Äù.

    "title": "STO vs ICO: investor rights & legal risks",
    "body": "2018/09/04 - STO vs ICO: investor rights &amp; legal risks: Part 2 of article series STO: Revolution in fundraising ‚Äî Wild West styled crypto anarchy did not last long. The initial excitement over ICOs‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämulti-million investments, 10x returns, no regulations, no taxation and no responsibilities‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähas faded as rapidly as it has started, when in late 2017 regulators all over the world realized that the party has gone too far. Several major Asian jurisdictions banned ICOs as a fundraising method, followed SEC‚Äôs (The United States Securities and Exchange Commission) chairman Jay Clayton ultimate statement, which created a panic on crypto markets:  ¬´Every ICO I‚Äôve seen is a security¬ª. The Commission later went less adamant on the matter, saying that bitcoin and ether are not securities, but some initial coin offerings may be. There are multiple issues about ICOs and ‚Äúutility‚Äù tokens that caused such an aggressive reaction from regulators in the first place. And the solution for these issues seems to be lying within the Security Token Offering concept. ICO problem ‚Ññ1: token status The status of tokens issued in the course of a fundraising campaign has been the stumbling block for the majority of ICOs. Most of projects consciously define their tokens as utilities‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääputting it simply, as an inner currency of a particular product or service, intended solely (de jure) for its operational needs. De facto, startups have been exercising in creativity while inventing the reasons why they can‚Äôt go on without their own token. The majority of projects don‚Äôt need their own token‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey just need investments. According to ICORating research only 3% of all tokens issued during ICO campaigns in 2018 are true utilities. Over 65% (!) function only as a payment form and can be easily replaced by fiat with no damage to the project‚Äôs economy. Now let‚Äôs take a look at investors: they really seldom buy tokens during an ICO campaign in order to buy services of a particular (and yet inexistent) application in a year or two. They do so to gain profits. Which is, by the matter of fact, can be considered as an indication of a security. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you called it a ‚Äúutility‚Äù in your white paper‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif it is a security, it has to comply with corresponding regulations. If you do not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääget yourself ready for the legal consequences that might come. STO solution: when doing an STO, founders do not have to invent a use case for their token within their platform/product/service in order to raise investments. Security tokens constitute financial instruments, backed by a particular asset (equity, debt, real estate, etc) and are fully compliant with all legal requirements. - ICO problem ‚Ññ2: investor rights As implied by the unclear token status, utility tokens do not provide investors with any rights, except for the use within a particular platform. Projects avoid stating any revenue promises in white papers, as they are legally not authorized to do so. It creates a tricky situation: investors want to gain profits, but they do not have any rights for any asset and revenue distribution. Plus, there are no guarantees that your tokens won‚Äôt be stolen as a result of a hack or that you will not forget or lose your account details, that can not be restored. No rights‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno protection‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääunclear perspectives. Nobody promised anything, right? STO solution: unlike utilities, security tokens provide investors with clearly defined (and fully legal) rights‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa share in a company, revenue distribution, voting rights‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthese parameters may vary, but these rights will be guaranteed as the whole process is backed by the over-100-year-old regulative system. Another important thing: only authorised investors are allowed to participate in a security token offering, having successfully passed KYC/AML and other checks. - ICO problem ‚Ññ3: high scam risk According to some estimations, about 80% of all ICOs in history were scams. In 2017 a lot of intentionally fraudulent projects took advantage of unregulated fundraising schemes and zero taxation. BananaCoin project, for example, attracted much attention (and laughs) in the Russian crypto space, when a group of people raised a couple million $ to expand their banana plantations in Laos. Soon after the ICO campaign it turned out that neither plantations nor even a registered company exist. The criminal charges did not seem to stop the founders, and they reportedly switched to mango business. So watch out for fruits. Another category consists of maybe benevolent but impractical daydreamers, who come out to the market with a single idea, not backed by any existent project‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand sometimes even an MVP. At the same time, unqualified investors without any technical or other professional background find it extremely hard to distinguish high-quality projects. This is enhanced by the lack of standardised reporting and audit in ICO environment, which complicates the monitoring of portfolio STO solution: while STO does not fully solve this problem by itself, the implementation of blockchain technology provides a very useful solution: the DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation) principle. First described by Vitalik Buterin, this concept suggests that the funds raised during an ICO are stored on a blockchain, and every new tranche is unlocked when a project successfully fulfills the next step of its roadmap, as voted by the token holders. Security token accelerator Evercity is the example how these two concepts‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSTO and DAO‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare brought together to ensure a more efficient, safe and transparent fundraising. Part 3.

    "body": "2018/08/27 - The past 10 years on global financial markets were marked by nothing more exciting than the blockchain frenzy. What has first started as a geek game is now giving us a key to bring the hundred-year-old financial system to a whole new level. Today, blockchain gives us an opportunity to democratize capital markets and to reverse the financial pyramid. But whether blockchain tech will help us build a more fair distributed world, or the Wall Street pharaohs are going to win again‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is yet to be decided. Gold fever of XXI century The world still can‚Äôt get over the ICO supernova blast of 2017 with all its multiple fundraising success stories and to-the-moon 100x investment returns. Since the fundraising method inception in 2014, over 1400 ICO campaigns were held in total, having cumulatively attracted $20 billion by the end of July 2018, according to CoinDesk. On average, ICOs brought the token holders 12,8x returns from their initial investment versus (only) 7,7x in ETH and 4,9x in BTC.  Let‚Äôs be honest: it did sound too good to be true. And it is now long gone, as regulators showed up to the party with more or less strict regulations and even ban schemes. Unlucky startupers who haven‚Äôt managed to wisely use (or hide) the attracted sums of money now find themselves under the risk of investigation. Despite the obsessive intentions of certain actors to restrict crypto in the first place, neither state authorities nor first-league market players failed to notice the ground-breaking (and money-saving) potential of the blockchain technology. It‚Äôs still early days for the blockchain to become a full-fledged part of financial landscape, as many regulatory aspects are yet unclear; but one thing absolutely is. Blockchain has come to stay, and we are about to see its first steps on the long journey to reverse traditional financial markets. This first step already has its name: security token offering. Security tokens are, basically, securities: traditional debt and equity instruments, issued in a digital form and accounted in a distributed (to one or other extent depending on the protocol) ledger. Imagine you are a small (let‚Äôs say, cannabis) farm owner in the States, and you want to expand your business by acquiring another field. Before the security token offering, you would have two basic options:  announce your ICO and try hard to invent the higher meaning for your issued ‚Äúutility‚Äù token to make the whole fundraising campaign sound legit. Tokens can be exchanged for a fixed amount of weed via special application? One token represents one cannabis patch? Or it is considered as ownership rights already? Euh‚Ä¶ go all the way through the traditional IPO process, which usually takes no less than 1,5 years of preparation and a lot of money. Like, A LOT. With security token offering, the whole process is brought down to several compliance procedures, several buttons on your laptop‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand people from all around the world can buy digital shares of your startup. According to various estimations, the newly created security token offering (STO) market has all chances to reach $10 trillion capitalization in the next few years, significantly democratizing and simplifying the fundraising process for tech and other startups. In the longer perspective, it is aimed to forever change the way we attract investments. Even NASDAQ, third biggest American stock market, lately shared an opinion at their website that security tokens are set to take center stage in 2019. The upcoming episodes of this article will provide an independent review of the existing fundraising markets‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäICO, IPO and VC‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the way they will evolve with the introduction and mass adoption of the ‚Äúnext big thing in crypto‚Äù: security tokens. We will compare traditional fundraising methods with STO and come up with an outlook on whether this new instrument has the potential to truly become a game changer for the financial industry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand who might be against it.

    "body": "2018/05/27 - Wild West crypto days are over. We knew that for a while now, but this week regulatory bodies all over the world came cracking down on ICOs with a series of anti-fraud investigations. Seems like it‚Äôs time to play safe. But what IS safe? The article is based on key note speech Alexey Shadrin (Evercity CEO) on Russian Blockchain Week 2018. : In the middle of May the whole crypto world had their eyes on Consensus conference in New York‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääevaluating, comparing, making their bets on coins that would go pumping right after the event. However, neither altcoins nor bitcoin itself saw to investors‚Äô expectations. Instead, Bitcoin started its bloody dump in the beginning of last week, dragging the whole market behind. Why? In fact, two curious (and rather controversial) events happened in the United States with just a week‚Äôs difference. You might have heard of the first one; the second, though, was left almost unnoticed by international media. Good cop‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbad cop: First, CFCT (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) representative Brian Quintenz gave a speech on the regulation issues during Consensus, that was referred to as ¬´very positive¬ª and ¬´comforting¬ª by the community. Re-emphasising SEC chairman Jay Clayton‚Äôs February comment, Brian addressed the unique nature of crypto tokens that can ¬´evolve¬ª and change their status from security to utility.  This is indeed a positive outlook on the uncertain state of the crypto-related industries compared to official SEC opinion. Now let‚Äôs get back to 2017 for a moment to see why SEC is being so hard on crypto market. In 2017 the amount of funds attracted to blockchain-related startups during ICOs reached $5,6 billion and significantly exceeded venture investments. And only during three months of 2018 this number went up to 118% of all the 2017! Source: EY research: initial coin offerings (ICOs) December 2017 A sheriff always comes for the Wild West: The statistics above make the second event that influenced the market this week less surprising. (The most surprising fact is that it was barely covered by major international media outlets). On May 21st (notice‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexactly the date where the market turned red!) state regulators unveiled a nationwide crackdown on suspicious cryptocurrency investment schemes which received a nice name ¬´Operation Cryptosweep¬ª.  NASAA (not to confuse with NASA)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNorth American Administrators Association, that unites regulators from over 40 jurisdictions, has initiated 70 investigations of suspicious and allegedly fraudulent ICOs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it is, according to the Association‚Äôs president, ¬´just the tip of an iceberg¬ª. So who is in the NASAA target list?  Top-management of companies that issued Utility tokens without registering them in SEC or using exemptions; Marketing agencies, listings and platforms that received percents from attracted funds; Advisors and consultants who received percents and assisted in circumventing the law; Bounty ¬´hunters¬ª. Meanwhile, other states across the globe didn‚Äôt hesitate to follow:  On May 24th Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) started turning up heat on an initial coin offering and warned 8 digital token exchanges for breaking securities, futures rules.  On May 25th UK authorities opened 24 investigations into crypto-related businesses. Some might find these cases much less amusing than the fake ICO offering website, launched by SEC earlier in May in order to educate investors about the typical fake ICOs signs.  We much appreciate SEC‚Äôs humour, but jokes aside, there is a more serious question. What‚Äôs next?: The answer might already be here under the name Security Token Offerings (STOs): it has all chances to become the next big thing on the crypto (and not only crypto) market. Security tokens have massive advantages over utilities, including representation of ownership, tradability and, most importantly full compliance with regulations (yes, we are going to play by rules here).  According to angel investor Gil Penchina, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting to see securites tokens with Bitcoin Capital‚Äôs BCAP, to brokers like Cointopia and Polymath, and enablers of security marketplaces in folks like tZERO and others. ‚Äù We shouldn‚Äôt forget that crypto market is still relatively small compared to mainstream markets‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääequity and debt markets for instance. Now imagine the $188 billion IPO (compared to $5. 6B ICO) market adopting Security Token Offering format, and other markets following? And it is quite likely to follow: owners would find tempting 24/7 access to their assets, especially with the New York Stock Exchange being open Monday-Friday 9:30am-4pm ONLY.  We would love to say that now we‚Äôll have security tokens, SEC and NASAA will leave ICOs alone, bitcoin will never fall again and we will all live happily ever after raising billions of dollars for cutting-edge startups (like Alibaba did, raising $21B by selling securities). But it is not that easy. Security token market growth faces multiple problems including much stricter KYC/AML, accredited investors only and poor infrastructure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso the questions of how are we going to issue and trade these tokens are still to be answered.  However, recent emergence and extreme success of such players as Polymath ($139 million raised, 100+ projects lined-up for their services), aimed at creating a security tokenisation platform, show that demand is high‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto say the least. Conclusions:  It seems like the moment when Utility tokens will wave their last good-bye is not too far ahead. Instead, fully compliant and regulated Security tokens step into game Security tokenisation has a 100x (hundreds billions of dollars!) market potential by means of replacing IPO model Infrastructure of Security issuing and trading is only being formed at the moment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich makes it a great opportunity to step enter. As we know, a smart investor only enters a growing market. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Alexey Shadrin Blockchain, Sustainability and Smart City evangelist, serial entrepreneur and key-note speaker.
