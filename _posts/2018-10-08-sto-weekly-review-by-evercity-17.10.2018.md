### [STO Weekly Review by Evercity 1–7.10.2018](https://medium.com/evercity-blog/sto-weekly-review-by-evercity-24-30-09-2018-6785670b6b73?source=collection_detail----15f6543a3084-----0---------------------)



**Main news**

🏙Manhattan steps into game: Fluidity/AirSwap and Propellr teams will tokenise $30 million worth of luxury real estate in the area. The offering will comply with Rule 506(c) of Reg D.

🔜Securrency announced the launch of its own Compliance Aware Token (CAT-20 и CAT-271) standards, that are interoperable ledger-agnostic security token protocols. Tokens can be issued and transferred across any blockchain, including Ethereum, Stellar, Ripple, GoChain and EoS, enabling «true liquidity».

🚀Security Token Industry Launch conference took place in NYC, with Merrill Lynch being one of the lead sponsors.

**Projects**

🏡BrickBlock announced the creation of the first tokenised real estate fund in the world together with Peakside Capital Advisors AG. The smart contracts ecosystem was audited by ConsenSys Diligence.

⛳️Crypto finance company Circle, founded in 2013 by Goldman Sachs, has acquired SeedInvest — equity crowdfunding platform and a broker-dealer. After the acquisition is approved, Circle will expand SeedInvest services, including the issuance of security tokens and stablecoins.

**Regulations**

⚔️New double precedent: for the first time SEC penalised two non-issuers for failing two register as a broker-dealer and as investment company:

1) TokenLot — platform for digital assets trading and 2) Crypto Asset Management (CAM), that misrepresented itself as the «first regulated crypto fund in the US». Notably, TokenLot was not charged for fraud, unlike all other previous SEC cases connected with crypto assets.
