### **STO Weekly Review by Evercity 11–17.02.2019**


#### Main news

🥁[Luxembourg](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/luxembourg) lawmakers have passed bill 7363 into law, facilitating the use of [blockchain](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain) technology in financial services. The new law aims provide financial market participants with more transparency and legal certainty in regard to the circulation of securities with blockchain technology. The bill is also geared to make the transfer of securities more efficient by reducing the number of intermediaries.

🇬🇧[TokenMarket](https://tokenmarket.net/), a “Global investment platform” announced its intent to raise up to £10 million in a [security token offering (STO)](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/02/144591-uk-based-tokenmarket-plans-10-million-security-token-offering-while-participating-in-fca-fintech-sandbox/amp/). Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the forthcoming STO is the fact that TokenMarket will be issuing the securities under the watchful eye of the UK Financial Conduct Authority. In July of 2018, TokenMarket was officially accepted by the FCA into their regulatory Fintech Sandbox. The FCA has been the trailblazer of the Sandbox concept — a process that has now been emulated in many jurisdictions around the world.
