### [STO Weekly Review by Evercity 27.08–02.09.2018](https://medium.com/evercity-blog/sto-weekly-review-by-evercity-20-26-08-2018-9f26d094d96f?source=collection_detail----15f6543a3084-----0----------------)

**Projects**

🤝American crypto exchange Bittrex acquired a 10% stake in Maltese blockchain company Palladium, which goal it to bring together ICO and IPO models. The project is aimed to raise 150 million EUR via _ICCO_ («initial convertible coin offering»). According to this model, investors will be able to convert their tokens into shares in three years from the issuance date.

🗽Security token trading platform OpenFinance has officially launched its Alternative Trading System (ATS). Tokens will be tradable on the platform after 12 months holding period. SPiCE VC tokenised fund became the first project to list its tokens.

🚤SPiCE VC has also joined Bancor Network, which will hold 5% of the project’s capital. It will ensure an opportunity to trade token funds for any currency or token within Bancor network, providing additional liquidity.

🐝Following SPiCE VC footsteps, one more tokenised fund — Swarm — has signed an agreement with OpenFinance to list their tokens on the platform.

**Regulations**

🤕Sports gambling platform Unikrn, having raised over $30 million during an ICO (with participation of such famous characters as Marc Cuban and Brock Pierce), has faced a class action lawsuit. The project is being accused of illegal selling of securities to the public. This is a curious twist, as Unikrn filed a «Form D» notice to SEC for the sale of unregistered securities to accredited investors through an investment contract known as a SAFT — Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. However, the project is being accused in selling tokens to a general public.
