For the past decades DNA analysis has gone a long way from a luxury to a (more or less amusing) feature, affordable to anybody (one of the most popularised company in the field 23andMe offers tests starting from $100).

That’s what you can learn today from a sample of your DNA:

1.  Inherited diseases and other potential health risks
2.  Your body response to medicaments (what is your optimal doze and possible side effects of drugs)
3.  Recommended diet and sports activities (extremely popular feature with those trying to lose weight)
4.  Cosmetology (hair and body products that perfectly suits you — every girl’s dream!)
5.  Where all your ancestors come from (if you haven’t seen Ancestry and Momondo ad «DNA Journey» that has gone viral a couple of years ago — we recommend to do so [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7FhU-G1_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7FhU-G1_Q). Warning: some might get emotional in the process)

Exciting, right? Well, not only to yourself!

You can imagine how valuable genetic data is to both scientific communities and corporate institutions. Among all, major FMCG and pharmaceutical companies use this information to create new products — and, unfortunately, they tend to monopolise the genomic databases, which leads to an increase in prices and inhibition of the science.

That’s where Evercity portfolio company ZENOME comes in, being the world’s first platform that creates a unified market of personal genomic information and services.

As part of a huge genomic ecosystem, all genetic data is stored in the distributed network in an anonymized, fragmented and encrypted form.  
 Zenome gives users an opportunity to store their genetic data on their personal computers and to sell it for research means, while serving a bigger goal of demonopolization of the big genomic data, reducing cost of a drug development and accelerating the development of science and medicine.
