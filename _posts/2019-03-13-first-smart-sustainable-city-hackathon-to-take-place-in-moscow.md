_How can blockchain help to ensure transparency and traceability in food and medication supply chain? How can AI optimize transportation networks or waste management system in a large retailer? How to increase energy efficiency using IoT? How can digital technologies help to improve environmental situation in a city?_

Evercity is happy to announce Smart Sustainable City hackathon — the first blockchain, AI and IoT hackathon for smart sustainable cities in Russia. Last year Evercity successfully held the first Russian Energy Blockchain Hackathon within international Climathon initiative. The event was supported by Hevel Solar, Schneider Electric, EDF, PJSC “Rosseti”, NP “Market Counсil” and other industry leaders.

Designed to become an impulse towards digital transformation, the hackathon is aimed at finding innovative sustainable business solutions for smart cities, implementing blockchain, IoT and AI technologies. Developers will create solutions in five tracks: **healthcare, energy, retail, transport, industry 4.0.**

The hackathon will take place on 19–21st April in coworking centre «Tochka Kipeniya» in Moscow. It is expected to attract over 200 developers, engineers, ecologists, entrepreneurs, designers and specialists in smart sustainable city with different expertise and skills.

The hackathon will consist of three parts: introductory workshop, online stage and offline stage. It will help to ensure the highest quality of developed solutions.
