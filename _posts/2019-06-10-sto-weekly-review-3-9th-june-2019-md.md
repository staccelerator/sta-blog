## Projects

💸 Early March 2019, the property “HelloWorld” located in Baar, Switzerland was tokenized (20%) and sold to 4 investors. Just days ago, the investors received their first rent payout (March, April) approx. XCHF 15'000 and were able to claim their share through the blockimmo platform, again in collaboration with Elea Labs and SwissCryptoTokens.

📊Cadence, which puts commercial debt into ERC-20 tokens, is now listed on Bloomberg Terminal. In a first for a blockchain-based financial instrument, Cadence has obtained a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI). 

▶️TradeCloud have announced the launch of the private round of their Swiss based $20 million Security Token Offering. TCST token has both utility and security features, allowing the token holder to exchange their tokens for internal credits on the TradeCloud platform at a discounted rate & receiving e a profit share from the company while holding the token. 

🏀Blockstation has recently announced Kawhi Coin (referring to NBA player Kawhi Leonard). This is a security token that will be distributed to investors in the #KaWhiWait movement. The goals of the offering are to entice Kawhi Leonard to re-sign with the Toronto Raptors this summer and to provide investors and basketball fans with an opportunity for a financial return.



## Regulation 

🇱🇮The Liechtenstein parliament approved the Blockchain Act during a first hearing. MP Daniel Seger (FBP) nailed it in one sentence, “We have to decide if we want to be pioneers, followers, or copycats.”

📝Boston Security Token Exchange LLC ("BSTX") filed with the United States SEC the proposed rulebook for the first regulated security token exchange. BOX Digital  and tZERO announced the BSTX joint venture on June 19, 2018 to become the world's first regulated exchange for trading security tokens. What is curious, BSTX proposed to «limit trading in security tokens to BSTX only».
