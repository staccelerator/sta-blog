### **STO Weekly Review by Evercity 18–24.03.2019**


#### Main news

🏦IBM is taking its banking clients a step closer to cryptocurrency. Announced Monday, [six international banks have signed letters of intent](https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-signs-6-banks-to-issue-stablecoins-and-use-stellars-xlm-cryptocurrency?utm_source=securitytoken-it-newsletter) to issue stablecoins, or tokens backed by fiat currency, on World Wire, an IBM payment network that uses the Stellar public blockchain. The network promises to let regulated institutions move value across borders — remittances or foreign exchange — more quickly and cheaply than the legacy correspondent banking system.

🇬🇧Smartlands, an aspiring global platform for security token issuance, [announced the acquisition](https://smartlands.io/news/smartlands-acquires-shojin-financial-services-limited-first-sto-underway/?utm_source=securitytoken-it-newsletter) of a major stake in Shojin Financial Services Limited (SFS) — a London-based company that in 2017 [received an investment license](https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_FirmDetailsPage?id=001b000001HiW5sAAF) from the British Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) allowing SFS to raise capital globally via crowdfunding.

#### Regulation

📃American Bar Association [released a major report](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/business_law/buslaw/committees/CL620000pub/digital_assets.pdf) on digital assets and cryptocurrency regulation. The 353-page document titled “Digital and Digitized Assets: Federal and State Jurisdictional Issues” provides definitions relevant to digital currency, domestic regulatory issues, and what international bodies and other countries are doing when confronted by the new technology.
