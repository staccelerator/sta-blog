**Main**

‚ú®Two Congressman for the United States have [introduced a bill] (https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2018/12/142631-legislation-designed-to-fix-icos-in-the-us-the-token-taxonomy-act-is-introduced-in-congress/)to exclude digital assets from being classified as securities. The bipartisan legislation (Soto is a Democrat &amp; Davidson a Republican) seeks to draw a ‚Äúbright line for businesses and regulators‚Äù by defining a ‚Äúdigital token‚Äù and clarifies that securities laws do not apply to companies that use blockchain once they reach their goal of becoming a functional network. The ‚ÄúSimple Agreement for Future Tokens‚Äù or SAFTs has been used as a security vehicle that morphs into a non-security once the token and platform are operational.

**Projects**

üêß[Medici Ventures,](https://www.mediciventures.com/) the leading blockchain accelerator and subsidiary of [Overstock.com, Inc.](https://www.overstock.com/), successfully used Ravencoin blockchain to transfer a digital securities token representing its equity ownership in [Chainstone Labs](http://www.chainstonelabs.com/).

ü§ù[TokenizEU](https://tokenizeu.com/), a European-based platform which aims to help companies issue EU-compliant security tokens, has committed to using [Ravencoin](https://ravencoin.org/) as a part of their services.

ü¶ñTokeny, the compliant tokenization platform, has announced the [T-REX standard](https://medium.com/tokeny/t-rex-the-token-standard-for-tokenized-securities-7e8f6c51b963)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa decentralized set of global tools, based on the Ethereum blockchain, to allow for the interoperable, frictionless and compliant transfer of tokenized securities.

üè†TokenSoft, a security token offering platform, has [partnered with Coinbase](https://www.coindesk.com/tokensoft-to-offer-coinbase-custody-as-sto-client-option) to provide an alternative custody solution for clients.
